# Unsupervised-ML-Customer-Segmentation
In this project, I was given extensive data on the bank's customers over a 6 month period. In this data provided, it includes the customer's transaction frequency, amount, tenure of being a customer with the bank, and many more.   The data is provided in the repository. The data can also be found on kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/arjunbhasin2013/ccdata)The task is to use the data provided to help launch a targeted marketing ad campaign that is designed for specific customer profiles. Part of this marketing program involves designing ads for 4 specific groups of customers (i.e. Transactors, Revolvers, New Customers, VIP/Prime). This targeted marketing should maximize the marketing campaign conversion rate.
